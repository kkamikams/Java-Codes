# Java-Codes

Welcome to my **Java Code** repository! 

This is a personal space where I will be storing, organizing, and improving my Java programs as I continue learning and exploring programming concepts. The main goal of this repository is to keep track of my progress, practice different coding techniques, and build a collection of solutions that I can revisit, study, and refine over time.  

For me, this repository acts like a digital notebook â€” a place to document my learning journey in a way that is organized and accessible. Each code I add here represents a step forward in my growth.

## About
This repository contains a variety of Java codes that I am working on as part of my learning journey. I will be experimenting with concepts such as variables, operators, loops, conditionals, classes, and eventually more advanced object-oriented programming principles like inheritance and polymorphism.  

I built this repository not just as storage but as a record of my development. It allows me to track how my coding style and problem-solving skills change over time. By organizing my work into different categories (such as examples, assignments, and projects), I can clearly see my own progress and recognize areas where I need more practice.
